# Asthma Attack Risk Detection using ML

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the risk of an asthma attack based on environmental pollutant levels like CO₂, O₂, and others. It includes model training, preprocessing, and a Flask-based app for deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that can be triggered by environmental pollutants. This project uses data on gas concentrations and other relevant features to predict whether an individual is at risk of experiencing an asthma attack.

### 🔍 Features
- Predicts **asthma attack risk** based on pollutant levels.
- Trained ML model saved in `.keras` format.
- Preprocessing pipeline saved as `.pkl`.
- Flask API (`app.py`) for integration or deployment.
- Dockerized environment for easier deployment.
