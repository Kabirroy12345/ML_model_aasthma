## 🚀 Overview

Asthma affects **300M+ people globally**, with environmental factors triggering life-threatening attacks.  
This project proposes a complete **Predictive Health Intelligence System** that:

✔ **Analyzes environmental pollutant exposure**  
✔ **Predicts asthma attack risk in real-time**  
✔ **Deploys on local devices or cloud as API**  
✔ **Aims to integrate with IoT wearable sensors & inhalers**

> A foundation towards a **Preventive Respiratory Healthcare Platform** powered by AI.
