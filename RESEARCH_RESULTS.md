## Feature Importance Analysis

### Permutation Importance (Top Features)

| Rank | Feature | Mean Decrease in Accuracy | Std |
|------|---------|--------------------------|-----|
| 1 | Asthma Symptoms Frequency | 0.068 | 0.016 |
| 2 | AQI | 0.055 | 0.015 |
| 3 | Poor Air Quality Exposure | 0.027 | 0.012 |
| 4 | PM2.5 | 0.024 | 0.016 |
| 5 | Night Breathing Difficulty | 0.022 | 0.008 |
| 6 | CO2 level | 0.017 | 0.012 |
| 7 | Temperature | 0.011 | 0.010 |

### Key Findings
1. **Clinical factors dominate**: Asthma symptoms frequency is the strongest predictor
2. **Environmental factors matter**: AQI and PM2.5 are significant contributors
3. **Exposure history important**: Poor air quality exposure ranks highly
4. **Night symptoms indicative**: Nighttime breathing difficulty is a reliable indicator

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that machine learning models, particularly gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, GradientBoosting, LightGBM), can effectively predict asthma risk from environmental and clinical factors. The feature importance analysis reveals that clinical symptom frequency is the most predictive factor, followed by air quality indicators (AQI, PM2.5).

The system achieves approximately 70% accuracy and 0.80 ROC-AUC on multi-class classification, providing a practical tool for asthma risk assessment that can be deployed in healthcare applications.
